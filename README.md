A workflow orchestration kit for Claude Code. Structured rules, agents, skills, and slash commands that make Claude plan before building, verify before closing, and self-improve after corrections.

## Install

Run this inside your project directory:

```bash
npx claude-workspace-kit init
```

Or using the short alias:

```bash
npx cwk init
```

This scaffolds all kit files into your project and creates a `.cwk.lock` file to track versions.

The installer is **interactive** and walks you through three steps:

1. **Git handling** — choose how the installed files are tracked or excluded in git
2. **Commit** — optionally stage and commit the files (only when choosing to track in git)
3. **Project context** — optionally run `/init` inside Claude Code to append codebase-specific context to `CLAUDE.md`

### Step 3 — Project context via `/init`

At the end of the install, the installer offers to launch Claude Code automatically:

```
  Add project-specific context via /init? [y/N]
```

If you accept, Claude Code opens with restricted tools. Type `/init` and Claude scans your codebase — entry points, folder structure, naming conventions — and appends a summary to `CLAUDE.md`. Type `/exit` when done.

This is non-destructive: existing `CLAUDE.md` content is never overwritten. You can also run it later manually:

```bash
claude  # then type /init inside the session
```

## Git Handling

If you are in a git repository, the installer prompts you to choose how git should handle the installed files:

```
  [1] Exclude locally   — write to .git/info/exclude (your clone only)
  [2] Add to .gitignore — shared with the team via .gitignore
  [3] Track in git      — commit the files with the repo
```

You can skip the prompt by passing a flag directly:

```bash
npx cwk init --git-exclude  # local-only exclusion via .git/info/exclude
npx cwk init --gitignore    # append to .gitignore (shared with the team)
npx cwk init --git-track    # no exclusion — commit the files with the repo
```

If you chose `--git-track`, the installer prompts whether to commit immediately. If you are on `main` or `master`, it also suggests creating a feature branch first:

```
  Suggested: chore/add-claude-workspace-kit
```

To commit manually later:

```bash
git add CLAUDE.md .claude/ docs/workflow/ tasks/todo.md tasks/lessons.md .cwk.lock
git commit -m "chore: add claude devkit"
```

Non-interactive installs (e.g. CI, piped scripts) default to `--git-exclude` and skip both the commit and `/init` prompts. A tip is printed at the end with manual instructions.

## Update

When a new kit version is published:

```bash
npx claude-workspace-kit@latest update
```

The update command uses a **file ownership model** to preserve your customizations:

| Tier | Behavior | Files |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Kit-managed** | Auto-updated to latest version | Skills, agents, commands, hooks, settings, workflow docs |
| **User-owned** | Never overwritten by update | `CLAUDE.md`, `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/lessons.md` |

Preview changes without writing anything:

```bash
npx claude-workspace-kit@latest update --dry-run
```

## Uninstall

To remove all kit-installed files from your project:

```bash
npx cwk uninstall
```

By default this removes only **kit-managed** files and the `.cwk.lock` lockfile. **User-owned** files (`CLAUDE.md`, `tasks/`) are left untouched.

To remove everything — including user-owned files:

```bash
npx cwk uninstall --all
```

Preview what would be removed without deleting anything:

```bash
npx cwk uninstall --dry-run
npx cwk uninstall --all --dry-run
```

Empty directories left behind after file removal are cleaned up automatically. Directories that still contain other files are preserved. Git exclusion entries added by the kit (in `.git/info/exclude` or `.gitignore`) are also removed.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `cwk init` | Interactive install — scaffolds all kit files |
| `cwk init --git-exclude` | Scaffold and write installed paths to `.git/info/exclude` (local only) |
| `cwk init --gitignore` | Scaffold and append installed paths to `.gitignore` |
| `cwk init --git-track` | Scaffold only — no git exclusion, commit files with the repo |
| `cwk init --force` | Re-scaffold all files, overwriting any existing ones |
| `cwk update` | Update kit-managed files to the latest version |
| `cwk update --dry-run` | Preview updates without writing any files |
| `cwk uninstall` | Remove kit-managed files and the lockfile |
| `cwk uninstall --all` | Also remove user-owned files (full cleanup) |
| `cwk uninstall --dry-run` | Preview what would be removed without deleting |

`cwk` is an alias for `claude-workspace-kit`.

### Claude Code slash commands

These run inside a Claude Code session (not in the terminal):

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/init` | Scan the codebase and append a project summary to `CLAUDE.md` |
| `/kickoff <task>` | Plan-first task launch — writes a checkable plan to `tasks/todo.md` before any implementation |
| `/verify-and-close` | Verification checklist before marking a task done — requires concrete proof |
| `/elegant-fix` | Elegance review of the current implementation — proposes a cleaner solution when something feels hacky |
| `/output-style terse` | Switch to compact output style |

## Customizing the Kit

**User-owned files** are yours to modify freely. They are scaffolded once and never touched by `update`:

- `CLAUDE.md` — Add project-specific rules and context (use `/init` to populate automatically)
- `.claude/rules/backend.md` — Adapt to your language, framework, or coding standards
- `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/lessons.md` — Used during development for planning and self-improvement

**Kit-managed files** receive upstream improvements automatically. If you need to customize a skill, agent, or command:

1. Create a *new* file alongside the kit version (e.g., `.claude/skills/my-custom-skill/SKILL.md`)
2. Leave kit-managed originals untouched so `update` continues to work

This way your customizations live alongside the kit without conflicts.

## What's Included

| Category | Files | Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow rules | `docs/workflow/workflow-orchestration.md` | Kit-managed |
| Root instructions | `CLAUDE.md` | User-owned |
| Path-scoped rules | `.claude/rules/backend.md` | User-owned |
| Agents | `.claude/agents/deep-reviewer.md`, `.claude/agents/fast-implementer.md` | Kit-managed |
| Slash commands | `.claude/commands/kickoff.md`, `.claude/commands/verify-and-close.md`, `.claude/commands/elegant-fix.md` | Kit-managed |
| Skills | `.claude/skills/{autonomous-bug-fixing,demand-elegance,plan-mode,self-improvement,subagent-strategy,verification}/SKILL.md` | Kit-managed |
| Settings | `.claude/settings.json` | Kit-managed |
| Hooks | `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` | Kit-managed |
| Output style | `.claude/output-styles/terse.md` | Kit-managed |
| Task tracking | `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/lessons.md` | User-owned |
| Memory | `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/memory/` | Outside repo — auto-loaded by Claude Code |
| Lock file | `.cwk.lock` | Kit-managed |

## How It Fits Together

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — loaded into every Claude Code session as system context.
- **`.claude/rules/backend.md`** — loaded only when Claude is working on files matching the `paths:` globs.
- **`.claude/agents/`** — subagents callable via the Agent tool (`subagent_type: deep-reviewer`).
- **`.claude/commands/`** — slash commands invokable with `/<name>` (e.g. `/kickoff Add OAuth`).
- **`.claude/skills/`** — auto-invoked when Claude judges the description matches the task.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** — defines which tools run without prompting and registers the SessionStart hook.
- **`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`** — runs at the start of every session; surfaces open `tasks/todo.md` items and prior `tasks/lessons.md` corrections so Claude reviews them before starting new work.
- **`tasks/todo.md` + `tasks/lessons.md`** — canonical persisted plan and lesson log.
- **`~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/memory/`** — personal cross-session memory, managed by Claude Code outside the repo. Use for user preferences, project context, and references that don't belong committed. Use `tasks/lessons.md` for anything team-shared.
- **`.cwk.lock`** — written by `npx cwk init`, read by `update` and `uninstall` to know which files are kit-managed vs user-owned.

## Compatibility

Uses Claude Code's native loader paths:
- `CLAUDE.md` (root instructions)
- `.claude/settings.json` (permissions, hooks)
- `.claude/agents/*.md` (subagents)
- `.claude/commands/*.md` (slash commands)
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (auto-invoked skills)
- `.claude/rules/*.md` (path-scoped modular instructions)
- `.claude/output-styles/*.md` (output styles)
- `.claude/hooks/*` (executable hooks referenced from settings.json)
